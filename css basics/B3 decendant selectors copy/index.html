<!-- Descendant Selector: The descendant selector allows you to select elements that are nested within other elements. It's defined by placing the ancestor selector followed by a space and then the descendant selector.
 
Explanation of the Descendant Selector:

    .another-paragraph span: This selector targets any <span> element that is a descendant (meaning it's inside, no matter how many levels deep) of an element with the class another-paragraph. The space between .another-paragraph and span is what defines the descendant relationship.
